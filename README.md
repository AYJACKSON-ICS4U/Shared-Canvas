I worked with sarah jordan and nikita but didnt understand much so i decided to do it on my own again

Here is what i learned

-How to use sockets

-How to run programs from terminal

-Using terminal to install JSON files

-Using data to track coordinates, then sending it to the terminal

-Sending the data from the terminal to the other page

-Nature of code was added in the other one, but not this one because I was doing this more fo rlearning, not complexity. :octocat:
